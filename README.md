# tidyzoning
This package was developed by a research team led by Professor Carole Voulgaris at Harvard University. It provides an automated workflow for extracting zoning requirements from the OZFS format, as detailed in our OZFS documentations. The package includes various check functions to filter parcel lots by comparing the corresponding building types with zoning regulations.
Additionally, it generates buildable areas for each parcel lot based on setback information and evaluates the compatibility between each tidybuilding and its designated buildable area. This approach builds upon insights from Matt Bhagat-Conwayâ€™s dissertation.
The required datasets including,
- Building feeds: Contains key building attributes such as height, number of stories, floor area, width, and depth. You can use our generating functions to design custom buildings.  
- Parcel feeds: Includes two datasets: 01.Parcel geo file, which has side classification, parcel type classification, and centroid points for each parcel. You can generate this dataset using our PECT Python package. 02.Parcel dimension file, including lot width(ft), depth(ft), and area(acre),generated by EPSG:3081 crs(NAD83 / Texas State Mapping System).  
- OZFS Zoning feeds: Converted from the Zoning Atlas into the OZFS format for standardized analysis, including zoning and overlay districts contraints.
